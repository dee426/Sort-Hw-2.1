# Sort-Hw-2.1


Problem Statement:


In this assignment, we want to extend the first assignment in two ways:

In addition to searching a sorted list of integer, it should be able to search a sorted list of strings. Strings are lexicographically sorted. We want to use the binSearch with minimal modification.  
A solution may change the signature of function binSearch from  binSearch(int[] aList, int key) to  binSearch(Comparable[] aList, Comparable key)  where Comparable is an interface in JDK https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html
 It must provide the following command-line arguments using Apache Commons CLI library https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-cli/
“--type”, to allow a user to specify types of input: “i” for integer and “s” for string 
 “--key” specifies the value of the search key
“--list”  specifies the sorted list of integers or strings. 
Examples: 
$ java Main --type i --key 6 --list 3 4 5 6
 Denotes that the list is of type integer, the search key is 6, and the list is 3 4 5 6 

$ java Main --type s --key ab --list a aa b  cc
Denotes that the list is type string, the key is “ab” and the list to perform search on is: a aa b cc

Packaging Requirements:
Use maven to specify the dependencies. In other words, do not check in jar files in the library.
“mvn compile” should compile your code without an error or warning.   


Submission:
Create a public repository on github. Check in your code and the pom.xml file in that repository.
Use “git tag” to tag your final submission.
Use “fork” and “pull request” in the GitHub to add your name, your project address, and submission tag to the “HW3.txt” file in this project: https://github.com/alipourm/SDfall2017.git

Deadline:
Monday Oct 30, 8:00 AM
